Hi, I'm Alice Smith — a Self-Taught Technologist & Systems Tinkerer

  I’ve always been drawn to understanding how things work. Instead of just using technology, I like to break it down, rebuild it, and make it better. I come from a support background and recently passed the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam. Now, I’m building a full-fledged home lab that spans Linux, Windows, and macOS — diving deep into virtualization, system management, retro gaming, and automation.

  My lab is hands-on, powered by real hardware — not cloud simulations. I work with tools like Proxmox, Docker, and ZFS, and manage everything from thin clients and headless servers to emulation stations and media servers. I keep things running across six core devices, each playing a role in my daily experiments, development, or home infrastructure.

  I learn by doing — breaking, fixing, and documenting every step. I use multiple free-tier ChatGPT accounts (Twizzhunter, iCloud, and this one) to sync my learning and keep track of problems and solutions as I go.

   Here’s what I currently work with:

-Core Operating Systems: Debian, Ubuntu Server 24.04, Proxmox VE, macOS Monterey, Windows 11
-Tools & Tech Stack: Docker, SMB, SSH, RDP, SPICE, Webmin, ZFS, BIOS/UEFI, RetroBat, RPCS3
-Remote Access: RustDesk, ZeroTier, Chrome Remote Desktop
-Storage Management: ZFS pools, BitLocker drives, microSD + USB external disks
-Scripting & Terminal Work: Bash, command-line disk imaging, automation
-Emulation: RetroArch, Dolphin, RPCS3 — with a mix of wired/wireless controller support

My Main Devices Include:

  iMac – My daily driver for emulator testing, research, and communication

  MSI GF63 Laptop – Portable setup for game development and remote work

  Omen Desktop (Power Tower) – Runs Proxmox, used for gaming and heavy VM workloads

  Wyse Thin Client – Headless Ubuntu Server for Docker, filesharing, and future NAS use

  Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) – Retro console and Docker sandbox

  MegaProx (Dell Laptop) – Lightweight Proxmox node and thin client controller

Gaming & Emulation Stack:

  I’m building a clean, plug-and-play retro gaming setup using RetroBat and The New Bat GUI on a 1TB drive. I test with:

  Pokémon Yellow (Game Boy)

  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess

  LittleBigPlanet 1–3 (PS3)

Controllers in rotation include PS4, GameCube (via adapter), 8BitDo, and Joy-Cons.

Current Projects:

  Turning the Wyse thin client into a Docker-powered NAS

  Expanding my thin client ecosystem using Proxmox with RDP and SPICE

  Organizing and optimizing my Jellyfin server for smooth playback and access

  Automating system backups and snapshots across devices

  Configuring clean vmbr0 networking across Proxmox nodes
