### About Me

I'm a self-taught technologist and hands-on problem solver with a passion for building practical IT infrastructure from the ground up. With a CompTIA A+ 1101 certification and experience across Linux, virtualization, Docker, and retro gaming, I thrive in hands-on environments where I can try, break, and fix systems to master them.

I specialize in repurposing old hardware into powerful utilities and managing a multi-device home lab with an eye for simplicity and efficiency.
